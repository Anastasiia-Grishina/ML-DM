# Machine Learning & Data Mining (ML-DM) Course

## Introduction
The lab assignments were completed as a part of course ML-DM course at Novosibirsk State University during 2016-2017 studying year.
The course was a part of the Master's Degree Program in Applied Mathematics and Informatics, Ill-Posed and Inverse Problems Specialization.
